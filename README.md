<h1>SR9011 vs S23 – What I Learned Using Both</h1>

<p>If you're trying to decide between <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>S23</strong>, this guide is going to help. I’ve used both, ran them solo, tracked my progress, and now I’m giving you the straight truth from my experience. These two aren’t in the same class technically—<strong>SR9011 is a Rev-ErbA agonist</strong>, and <strong>S23 is a powerful SARM</strong>. But they’re often compared because they both <strong>boost fat loss and body recomposition</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll break down how each worked for me, how I used them, side effects, and who each one is best for. Plus, if you’re ready to test one yourself, I’ve linked my trusted sources under each section.</p>

<h2>SR9011 – Clean Energy and Fat Burning Without Muscle Loss</h2>

<p><strong>SR9011</strong> is not technically a SARM. It’s a <strong>Rev-ErbA agonist</strong> that influences your body’s internal clock and metabolism. I used it during a cut at <strong>20mg twice daily for 6 weeks</strong>. It works best split into two doses because of the short half-life (around 4 hours).</p>

<h3>My Results on SR9011:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Faster fat loss – especially around the waist</li>
  <li>Increased stamina during fasted cardio</li>
  <li>Very noticeable appetite control</li>
  <li>No muscle loss despite low calories</li>
  <li>Improved sleep schedule and energy levels</li>
</ul>

<p>This felt more like a <strong>fat burner and energy optimizer</strong> than a muscle drug. I didn’t feel suppressed, didn’t crash, and my cardio went up like crazy. It made my workouts feel smoother and more consistent—especially in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Great fat loss and endurance booster</li>
  <li>No testosterone suppression</li>
  <li>No PCT needed</li>
  <li>Stackable with any SARM or cycle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Very short half-life – needs 2-3 doses/day</li>
  <li>Won’t help with strength or muscle growth</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Fat Loss, Cardio, Endurance</p>

<h2>S23 – The Hardest-Hitting SARM I’ve Tried</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is a full androgen receptor agonist. It's often called the most powerful SARM for a reason. I ran it at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a hard cut while keeping my protein high. The strength retention and muscle hardness were unlike anything I’ve experienced from other SARMs.</p>

<h3>My Results on S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Crazy muscle density and hardness</li>
  <li>Strength gains even while cutting</li>
  <li>Full vascularity and dry look by week 3</li>
  <li>Some aggression in the gym (not bad)</li>
  <li>Test suppression after week 4</li>
</ul>

<p>S23 definitely comes with suppression. By the end of the cycle, my libido dipped and sleep got a little rough. I used a mini PCT afterward (clomid/nolva for 3 weeks) and everything bounced back. Still, I’d only recommend this if you’ve run other SARMs before.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum lean mass retention</li>
  <li>Extreme definition and dryness</li>
  <li>Strength boost on low calories</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong suppression – PCT is a must</li>
  <li>Possible sleep issues</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Advanced Cutting, Dry Muscle Gains, Strength</p>

<h2>SR9011 vs S23 – Which One Should You Choose?</h2>

<p>This depends 100% on your goal:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Compound</th>
      <th>Goal</th>
      <th>Strength Gains</th>
      <th>Fat Loss</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>SR9011</strong></td>

      <td>None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Hard Cutting, Strength</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>High</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you're new, or just want to <strong>lean out without side effects</strong>, SR9011 is the safer pick. It won’t grow muscle but it helps you keep what you have while burning fat.</p>

<p>If you’ve used SARMs before and want to get <strong>shredded while holding onto strength</strong>, S23 is elite—but don’t skip PCT.</p>

<h2>How I Test and Rate My SARM Cycles</h2>

<p>Just like with AC262 and YK11, I ran both SR9011 and S23 solo with clean diet and consistent training. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight and lean mass (weekly measurements)</li>
  <li>Strength on bench, squat, and deadlift</li>
  <li>Side effects – mood, sleep, libido, aggression</li>
  <li>Suppression symptoms – fatigue, libido, motivation</li>
</ul>

<p>I also got bloodwork before and after. S23 tanked my test levels by ~60% by end of cycle. SR9011 had zero impact.</p>

<h2>FAQs – SR9011 vs S23</h2>

<p>No. It’s a Rev-ErbA agonist that boosts metabolism and fat loss but doesn’t bind to androgen receptors.</p>

<h3>Does SR9011 need PCT?</h3>
<p>No. It doesn’t cause suppression or hormonal issues. No PCT needed.</p>

<h3>Can I stack SR9011 and S23?</h3>
<p>Yes. They actually stack well—SR9011 for energy and fat burn, S23 for muscle retention and strength. Just be sure to run a PCT after.</p>

<h3>Is S23 safe?</h3>
<p>It’s powerful, but with strong suppression. Safe if you follow proper PCT and limit cycles to 6–8 weeks max.</p>

<h3>Where do you buy your SARMs?</h3>
<p>I only use these two sources for purity and consistency:</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Both SR9011 and S23 helped me drop fat—but in very different ways. <strong>SR9011</strong> helped with energy, cardio, and clean fat burn without touching hormones. <strong>S23</strong> gave me serious strength and muscle definition, but it came with suppression and side effects.</p>

<p>If you want a no-hassle fat loss boost: go with <strong>SR9011</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to get absolutely peeled and can handle a strong cycle and PCT: try <strong>S23</strong>.</p>
